<p>Hi there, time traveler.</p><p>The package named <code>yeoman</code> was deprecated several years ago. It is now called <code>yo</code>. To install, run:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>npm -g install yo
</code></pre></div><p>It is probably a good idea to refer to our <a href=http://yeoman.io>official website</a> for up to date documentation.</p>
